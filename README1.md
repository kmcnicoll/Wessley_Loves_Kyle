Project Goals:

    Our goals for this project was to evaluate the popularity of media in the forms of Television and Movies in order to give an informed presentation on whether Microsoft should invest in a streaming service catering to movie watchers or television watchers. We had hoped to reference our data with client engagement against movie success and revenue but we came across a few hiccups in retrieving the necessary data. We had hoped to cross reference the user ratings score on IMDB.com with the amount of engagement these shows and movies experienced on Twitter.com, but accessing Twitter's API privileges proved to be a greater challenge than initially anticipated, causing us to give up on social media engagement. Furthermore, budgeting and revenue for films and television shows were not readily accessible for the majority of our data through IMDB.com. Turning to TheMovieDB.com we were able to grab the 10,000 highest rated shows and judged them on their quality compared to their user ratings. We did the same for the top 250 television shows and movies in IMDB.com, as well as gathering the amount of votes they received, in the hopes of comparing the levels of engagement against each other, proving that Televion grabs a more loyal fanbase. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach all of our project goals, as we neglected to retrieve the top 250 shows and movies by drama, which would have hopefully given us further insight into the watching habits in mainstream television.
